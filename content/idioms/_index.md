## Single Assignment

**Avoid:**

```swamp
mut a = 0
if something {
  a = 4
} else {
  a = 5
}
```

**Prefer:**

```swamp
a = if something 4 else 5
```

**Avoid:**

```swamp
mut direction = Vec2 { .. }
if input == Input::Left {
    direction = Vec2::new(-1, 0)
} else if input == Input::Right {
    direction = Vec2::new(1, 0)
} else {
    direction = Vec2::new(0, 0)
}
```

**Prefer:**

```swamp
direction = match input {
    Left  -> Vec2::new(-1, 0),
    Right -> Vec2::new(1, 0),
    _     -> Vec2::new(0, 0),
}
```

{% note(type="principle") %} One assignment tells the whole story â€” mutation muddies it. {% end %}

## ZII = Zero Is Initialization

> Zero should always be safe. Zero means nothing, and nothing is safe.


Embrace zero and [ZII]. The value `0`, `none`, or the _first_ variant of an enum (discriminant is zero for the first) should always be safe and well-defined.
This makes it easy to check for "empty" or "non-existent" without introducing optional types.

The benefit is not just simpler code, but also leaner code generation --- the compiler doesn't need to emit extra instructions for wrapping and unwrapping optionals.

{% figure(src="option_overhead.png", alt="Option Overhead", width=400) %}
Comparison of memory layout between `Int` and `Int?`
{% end %}

Only use ZII if there is a "natural" existing field that can be used to detect if the type is "nothing", inactive or harmless. Do not add a field just to make it ZII, use an optional in that case: `T?`.

**Avoid:**

```swamp
struct Avatar {
    id: Int,
}

fn find_avatar(distance: Int) -> Avatar? {
    ...
}


avatar = find_avatar(20)
when avatar {
    render_avatar(avatar)
}
```

**Prefer:**

```swamp
struct Avatar {
    id: Int,
}

// id will be zero if avatar is not found
fn find_avatar(distance: Int) -> Avatar {
    ...
}

avatar = find_avatar(20)
if avatar.id != 0 {
    render_avatar(avatar)
}
```

### Enums and ZII

The first variant of an enum is always the zero value --- and it should always be safe. This way, an uninitialized or default value never causes harm.

```swamp
enum Action {
    Idle,
    DrinkingPotion,
}

fn avatar_do_action(avatar: Avatar, action: Action) {
    match action {
        Idle -> {} // nothing "unsafe" happens
        DrinkingPotion -> avatar.health += 100,
    }
}
```

### When Zero Can't Mean "Nothing"

Sometimes zero is a valid value: coordinates, vectors, matrices, and other numeric types where 0 has real meaning. In these cases, you cannot reserve zero to signal "empty."

For these types, use an optional (`T?`) instead.

## Rest `..` Operator

> Fill in what matters, zero the rest.

When creating struct literals, the `..` operator automatically sets all unspecified fields to their zero value. This makes code shorter, clearer, and consistent with the ZII principle.

Instead of manually filling in every field, you can focus only on the values that matter --- the rest are guaranteed safe because zero is safe.

If a the type being constructed has a `default()` associated member function, that will be used, if not if a field that is initialized has a `default()` member function, that will be used for each field initialized.

Avoid (explicit zeroes):

```swamp
struct Player {
    id: Int,
    score: Int,
    gold: Int,
    last_checkpoint: Int,
}

player = Player {
    id: 42,
    score: 0,
    gold: 0,
    last_checkpoint: 0,
}
```

Prefer (rest operator):

```swamp
struct Player {
    id: Int,
    score: Int,
    gold: Int,
    last_checkpoint: Int,
}

player = Player {
    id: 42,
    ..
}
```

## Max Four Parameters

> Functions should be simple to call and easy to read.

Functions with many parameters are confusing: the order is easy to mix up, the meaning of each argument is unclear, and the code becomes harder to maintain.

There's also a **performance cost**:

- Each parameter must be stored to a temporary register, moved into ABI order, and sometimes copied back for scalars.

- On many platforms, when the number of parameters grows, extra ones must be spilled to the stack, introducing memory traffic and alignment adjustments.

- With a ready struct, the overhead is minimal --- just passing the pointer to the struct.

Instead, if you must have more than four arguments, group related values into a named or anonymous struct and pass that as a single argument. This improves readability, makes the code self-documenting, and lets you extend later without breaking call sites.

Note that if some fields are mutable and some are not, you need to create two different structs. Unfortunately there is currently a bug where you need to set storage for those fields, but that will change in the future.

Functions with many parameters are harder to use correctly. Research suggests developers struggle with more than four parameters [RamaKak2013], and psychology shows that people can juggle around four items in working memory [Cowan2010].

**Avoid:**

```swamp
fn draw_avatar(x: Int, y: Int, rotation: Float, scale: Float, opacity: Float, avatar: Avatar) {
    ...
}

draw_avatar(120, 200, 0.0, 1.0, 0.8, Avatar {..})
```

**Prefer:**

```swamp
struct DrawParams {
    x: Int,
    y: Int,
    rotation: Float,
    scale: Float,
    opacity: Float,
}

fn draw_avatar(params: DrawParams, avatar: Avatar) {
    ...
}

fn draw_spaceship(params: DrawParams, spaceship: Spaceship) {
    ...
}

draw_avatar(DrawParams {
    x: 120,
    y: 200,
    rotation: 0.0,
    scale: 1.0,
    opacity: 0.8,
}, Avatar {..})
```

## Use Anonymous Structs for Rare Cases

> Don't name what you only use once.

If a group of fields is only used in one or a few places, there's no need to define a named struct for it.

Anonymous structs are perfect for bundling values together for a single call site or a temporary grouping.

```swamp
fn draw_special_button(special_params: {
    width: Int,
    color: Color,
    tab_count: Int,
} )


draw_special_button( {
    width: 10,
    color: Color::new(1.0, 0.8, 0.8),
    tab_count: 1,
} )
```

### Use in sub structs inside a struct

If the struct grouping is not used in many places, use an anonymous struct:

```swamp
struct Avatar {
    target_info: { unit: Unit, distance: Int }, // This is only used for the avatar target info
    speed: Int,
}
```

## Scopes or `with` Blocks Over Single-Use Functions

> Functions are for reuse. Scopes are for structure (and speed).

It's good practice to group related code into scopes `{}` or `with` blocks for readability. But don't create named functions that are only ever called once or twice. If the code isn't reused, keep it inline --- it makes the flow easier to follow and avoids cluttering your code with unnecessary names.

Single-use helpers force the compiler to juggle calling conventions: shuffle args into temps, reorder for the ABI, push/pop callee-saved registers, emit prologue/epilogue, branch to `call` and back on `ret`. Inline scopes skip all of that, yielding fewer instructions and better cache/branch behavior.

Inline code is easier to refactor. You don't have to update function signatures or chase down call sites when adding or removing a local variable.

**Avoid:**

```swamp
fn draw_main_menu() {
    draw_new_game_button() // new_game_button will only be called from here
    draw_quit_game_button() // quit_game_button will only be called from here
}
```

**Prefer:**

```swamp
fn draw_main_menu(gfx: Gfx) {
    // New Game Button
    {
        draw_button_border(gfx, BLUE)
        draw_text(LocalizedString::NewGame)
    }

    // Quit Game Button
    {
        draw_button_border(gfx, GREEN)
        draw_text(LocalizedString::QuitGame)
    }
}
```

**Or:**

```swamp
fn draw_main_menu() {
    // New Game Button
    with gfx {
        draw_button_border(gfx, BLUE)
        draw_text(LocalizedString::NewGame)
    }

    // Quit Game Button
    with gfx {
        draw_button_border(gfx, GREEN)
        draw_text(LocalizedString::QuitGame)
    }
}
```

Note: Another upside with scopes is that variables defined in the scope are not taking up registers outside the scope. The variable name can therefor be reused in other scopes.

## Associated Functions

> Keep behavior with the type it belongs to.

When a function conceptually belongs to a type, make it an associated function (`impl`) instead of a free function.

This has two big advantages:

- **Discoverability:** Code completion and intellisense will show all available functions when you type value and a dot `.`. You don't have to remember the name of free functions.

- **Documentation:** The impl block becomes the single place to look when you want to know what operations a type supports.

**Avoid (free function):**

```swamp
fn avatar_target_range(a: Avatar) -> Int {
    a.base_range + a.boosted_range
}
```

**Prefer (associated member):**

```swamp
impl Avatar {
    fn target_range(self) -> Int {
        self.base_range + self.boosted_range
    }
}
```

## No Strings

> Strings are for people, not for game code.

In game code you should rarely use strings. Strings are very heavy: they take more memory, require extra allocations, and slow down comparisons.

Worse, strings lose information. If you turn structured data (like an ID or a health value) into a string, you throw away its type and meaning. Getting it back requires error-prone parsing (never ever do that) --- and usually ends up slower and less flexible.

Use identifiers, enums, or numeric handles instead. Strings should only appear **as late as possible** in rendering --- that way you can support localization, keep your game code lightweight, and preserve information in its structured form.

- **Memory:** numbers and enums are _far_ cheaper to store than strings.

- **Performance**: string comparisons and hashing are _much_ slower than integers.

- **Information**: strings flatten structured data and throw away semantics.

- **Flexibility**: separating data from presentation is a good general rule anyway, and makes localization and content changes easy.

{% note(type="principle") %} Strings belong at the edge of your game â€”-- for the player, not the game code. Inside the game, keep information structured.
{% end %}

**Wrong:**

```swamp
if action == "DRINK_POTION" {
    avatar.health += 100
}
```

**Right:**

```swamp
enum Action {
    Idle,
    DrinkPotion,
}

if action == Action::DrinkPotion {
    avatar.health += 100
}
```

**Sometimes:**

There are only a few valid uses of strings in Swamp code:

- **Debugging, assertions, panics and logging:**

```swamp
info('loading level {level_id}')
debug('new game was selected')
print("starting boss fight")
assert(avatar.velocity < 1000, "Avatar unreasonable velocity")
panic("value was out of range")
```

- **Storing player names:** e.g. names coming from external services(Steam, PSN, etc.).

- **Presentation edge:**

When rendering localized, interpolated strings to the player

```swamp
enum LocalizedStringId {
    StartGame,
    AreYouSure,
}

enum Language {
    Swedish,
    English,
}

fn get_localized_string(
    language: Language,
    id: LocalizedStringId,
    game: Game) -> String {
    ...
}
```

- **Parsing text formats**

Parsing text formats should usually be done by the engine, not in Swamp --- but there are times when it's necessary.

Everywhere else: keep your data structured.

## No Defensive Coding

> A hidden bug is a delayed disaster.

Do not accept faulty states or "fix" them silently by clamping, resetting, or ignoring invalid values. This only hides the real bug and makes it harder to track down.

Instead, fail fast and loud with asserts. During development, asserts will catch invalid states immediately. In release builds, they can be stripped automatically, so they don't cost performance.

**Wrong (defensive coding):**

```swamp
fn update_avatar(mut avatar: Avatar) {
    if avatar.gold < 0 {
        avatar.gold = 0 // silently fix
    }
}
```

**Right:**

```swamp
fn update_avatar(mut avatar: Avatar) {
    assert(avatar.gold >= 0, "Gold amount should never be negative")
}
```

**Wrong (defensive coding):**

```swamp
my_position = match get_joystick_value() { //this can only ever be between 0-127
    0 -> 0,
    1..127 -> 1,
    _ -> 0 // defensive coding, we are handling an illegal value
}
```

**Right:**

```swamp
my_position = match get_joystick_value() { // this can only ever be between 0-127
    0 -> 0,
    1..127 -> 1,
    _ -> panic("joystick value was not in range")
}
```

{% note(type="principle") %} Bugs should surface at the moment they happen, not be hidden under "safe defaults."{% end %}

### When Clamping Is Okay

Clamping or handling wrong states are valid in two situations:

1. At the edges of the game --- when input comes from outside sources you cannot fully control (e.g. input, hardware, or network).

2. As part of the simulation rules --- when the game design itself defines a hard limit.

```swamp
// Movement speed cannot exceed max velocity by design
avatar.velocity = avatar.velocity.clamp(0, MAX_VELOCITY)
```

## Compile time over Runtime

> Decide as early as possible.

Swamp is designed for determinism and performance. When a value can be known at compile time, prefer to make it a constant instead of computing or looking it up at runtime.

This leads to:

**Performance:** fewer runtime instructions.

**Predictability:** no hidden work during simulation.

**Simplicity:** easier to reason about when values never change.

**Avoid:**

```swamp
fn update_physics() {
    gravity = 9 * 1000 / 60  // recalculated every tick
    velocity += gravity
}
```

**Prefer (compile-time constant):**

```swamp
const GRAVITY_PER_TICK = 9 * 1000 / 60 // this will only be calculated _once_ when the game starts up.

fn update_physics() {
    velocity += GRAVITY_PER_TICK
}
```

## Code Is Data

If you know the data ahead of time, bake it directly into the code as constants instead of loading from a file.

**Avoid (runtime loading):**

```swamp
fn load_cards() -> [Card] {
    read_json_file("cards.json")
}
```

**Prefer (compile time):**

```swamp
struct Card {
    id: Int,
    name: LocalizedStringId,
    power: Int,
}

const CARDS = [
    Card { id: 1, name: LocalizedStringId::Fireball, power: 5 },
    Card { id: 2, name: LocalizedStringId::Healing,  power: 3 },
]
```

Here the entire card library is in constant memory. No runtime parsing, no file I/O, no indirection --- just direct access to data that never changes.

{% note(type="principle") %} If you already know it, compile it in. Runtime is for the unknown. {% end %}

## Type Inference

> Infer more, clutter less.

Swamp's type inference makes code shorter, cleaner, and easier to read. Explicit types are only needed when type cannot be inferred.

**Avoid:**

```swamp
player: Player = Player::new()
score: Int = 0
```

**Prefer (inferred):**

```swamp
player = Player::new()
score = 0
```

**Sometimes:**

Optionals and other cases where a value has multiple meanings may need explicit annotation.

```swamp
maybe_score: Int? = 0
```

Here, zero is wrapped in `Some`, making the type explicit.

{% note(type="principle") %} Infer the obvious, state the meaningful. {% end %}

## Return Values Instead of Mutating Parameters

> Builders should build --- not patch.

If a function's purpose is to initialize a value, make it return that value. Don't take an existing variable as a `mut` parameter and fill it in.

This makes such functions easy to use directly inside struct initializers and expressions, where mutation isn't possible. It also improves performance: returning writes the result directly into the struct field (via sret), avoiding a separate variable and the extra store/"copy" into the field.

**Avoid (mutating parameter):**

```swamp
fn create_spawn_from_id(mut pos: Position, id: Int) {
    pos = Position { x: id, y: 0 }
}

a = Avatar {
    position: {
        mut p = Position {..}
        create_spawn_from_id(&p, 42)
        p
    },
}
```

**Prefer (returning the value):**

```swamp
fn create_spawn_from_id(id: Int) -> Position {
    Position { x: id, y: 0 }
}

a = Avatar {
    position: create_spawn_from_id(42),
}
```

## Tuples for Small, Self-Explanatory Groups

For small, short-lived groups where order is obvious, prefer a tuple. Tuples avoid boilerplate and keep code concise.

If the grouping is reused, or if field names add clarity, use a struct instead.

**Avoid:**

```swamp
struct Coords {
    x: Int,
    y: Int,
}

fn move_avatar(delta: Coords) { ... }

move_avatar(Coords { x: 5, y: -3 })
```

**Prefer (tuple):**

```swamp
fn move_avatar(delta: (Int, Int)) { ... }

move_avatar((5, -3))
```

## Guards Over If-Else Chains

Guards read top-to-bottom: the **first** true condition yields the value. They remove nesting, flat, scannable logic, make intent explicit, and gives a clear default with `_`.

**Avoid (if-else ladder as an expression):**

```swamp
fn classify(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    if a > 3 {
        4
    } else if b < 9 && a > 4 {
        99
    } else {
        0
    }
}
```

**Prefer (guards):**

```swamp
fn classify(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    | a > 3              -> 4
    | b < 9 && a > 4     -> 99
    | _                  -> 0
}
```

## Comment with purpose

> Comments explain _why_, code shows _how_.

Explain intent, constraints, and trade-offs. The code already shows what happens and how --- donâ€™t narrate it.

- Use `///` **Markdown doc comments** just before types and functions.

- Use `//!` for module/package files (e.g., `lib.swamp`, `main.swamp`).

- Avoid line-by-line `//` inside functions (except for TAGS, see below); reserve `//` for **scope headers** or **block notes** (e.g., a `{ ... }` or `with` block).

{% note(type="unimplemented") %}
Scanning and parsing of Markdown doc comments is not implemented yet.
{% end %}

Write doc comments when the **name + signature aren't self-explanatory**.
If a function is short and obvious, prefer clear names over doc comments.

State invariants should be asserts and not comments.

**Avoid (narrating):**

```swamp
fn tick(mut avatar: Avatar) {
    // increase stamina
    avatar.stamina += 1

    // if alive then move
    if avatar.health > 0 {
        // move right
        avatar.pos.x += 1
    }
}
```

**Prefer (just code)**:

```swamp
fn tick(mut avatar: Avatar) {
    avatar.stamina += 1

    if avatar.health > 0 {
        avatar.pos.x += 1
    }
}
```

### Function Doc Comments

First paragraph should be a short summary of what the intent is, usually without (extensive) markdown.

You can add sections with `#`. Subsections `##`, `###` are possible but rarely needed.

You refer to parameters with `` `parameter` `` and types with `` `module::sub_module::Name` ``

Code blocks are wrapped in `` ``` ``, and default to Swamp.

````swamp
/// Updates the avatar simulation.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `self`: the `shared_types::Avatar` to be simulated.
/// - `game_grid`: grid used for movement and collisions.
///
/// # Effects
///
/// Increases stamina; moves only when alive.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// mut avatar = Avatar { .. }
/// avatar.tick((10, 20), game_grid)
/// ```
fn tick(mut self, game_grid: Grid) {
    ...
}
````

### Tracking Tags

Use tags for actionable work items --- short, imperative, and easy to grep.

**Semantics**:

- **TODO**: planned work that's safe to defer for later (feature, improvement, refactor, docs, tests).

- **HACK**: Intentional workaround that violates the ideal solution for a specific reason (deadline, demo, dependency). Should include a removal plan.

- **FIXME**: something is wrong **now** (bug, correctness/safety issue, crash, broken invariant). Bugs should generally be fixed _right away_, but it is decided to be temporarily deferred (e.g., lower priority, blocked, or awaiting info).

- **BUG**: known defect/limitation with unique id, often cross-cutting and almost always tracked in external bug tracker.

- **NOCHECKIN**: temporary commit/merge blocker. Any change containing it **must not be** committed, pushed, or merged; **pre-commit** hooks and **CI** should fail when it's present. Use it to fence off local test code, WIP refactors, or temporary hacks that aren't meant to ship.

The tag format is `TAG(optional-info)[optional-category]: message`:

- `TAG` is `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK` or `BUG`. for local use: `NOCHECKIN`.

- `optional-info` (in **parens**) can include issue IDs, owners, dates:
  `(#233,@piot,2025-08-12)`

- `optional-category` (in **brackets**) is a short bucket like:
  `[perf] [safety] [refactor] [docs] [test]`

- Prefer **one** category; add more only if it truly helps.

**Good message style**:

- Imperative: _"avoid...", "add...", "split...", "bounds-check..."_

- Specific condition: _"when count == 0"_

- One concern per tag.

```swamp
